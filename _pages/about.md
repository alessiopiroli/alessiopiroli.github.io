# About Me

I am a Master student in Information Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Siena (Italy) where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Engineering.
In my spare time I enjoy doing sports, playing the piano and reading.
